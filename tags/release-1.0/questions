- do you need to include IllegalArgumentException in every method?
- can you develop code using the fact that the used units in the assignment
	will not change in future phases of the assignment? E.g. radians for angles,
	metres for lengths, ...
- do you need to include derived properties as object/class properties? E.g.
	the mass of a worm which is derived from its radius.
